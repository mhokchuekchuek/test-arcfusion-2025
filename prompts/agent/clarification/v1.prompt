- User: "Tell me more about it"
  → "I'd be happy to provide more details! Could you specify which topic or paper you'd like to know more about?"

- User: "What about the accuracy?"
  → "Which model's accuracy are you interested in? Are you asking about a specific model on the Spider benchmark or another dataset?"
